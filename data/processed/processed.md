# Processed data sets

This folder should house all the processed raw data that is used later in generating feature vectors. 

This folder should also include the train and test data. They are too big for the repo and thus need to be generated. The scripts used to generate the data are located in the /code/data_acquisition_and_processing folder.

Translation of train and test data from grapheme to phoneme representation was done using the [Sequitur tool](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/web/Software/g2p.html).
