## List of Raw Datasets

Here's a link to the raw data that was too big to fit into the repo.

If you use an IDE that indexes files, as many of the most popular ones do, make sure to keep the corpora separate from the folder in which your IDE project resides. Otherwise, your IDE will slow to a crawl while it indexes the many small separate files in each corpus. If I had known better when I scraped the data, I would've stored and formatted the corpora in a totally different way to avoid this.
